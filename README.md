## Introduction

Hello! My name is Wyatt Perkins and welcome to my portfolio that showcases the data analysis projects I have completed. 

In this repository, you will find a find a number of folders. Each folder possesses a project that I completed in which I demonstrate my use of the following:
    
 - Data cleaning and analysis with R programming
- Data cleaning and analysis with Microsoft Excel
- Data visualizations using R programming and Microsoft BI
- And others!

In the sections of this README file that follow, I will give a brief summary of the path that I walked to becoming a data analyst, as well as providing a description of each project that is contained within this portfolio.

## My Background

Before starting my data analyst journey, I was a high school mathematics teacher for 8 years. I loved teaching and working with my students. However, during my last year, I decided that it was time for a career change that offered me more of a work and life balance. I have always loved mathematics and how it can be used to help people solve their problems. When I came across a description for a possible career in data analysis, I became really interested. After some more research, I decided that it was the path I wanted to pursue. 

Since then, I have earned my Google Data Analytics Certification and have completed a number of projects that showcase the many skills I have gained.    

## Project #1: Bellabeat Case Study for Customers' Usage of Fitness Smart Devices

This project focused on me using data provided by smart fitness devices to determine the common trends for people who use them, and then analyze those trends to determine and offer recommendations to the company requesting this analysis in order to grow their company. The data's processing, analysis, and visualizations were all completed using R Programming. This was also the capstone case study that I completed in order to earn my Google Data Analytics Certification. 

## Project #2: Analysis of Video Game Data for Different Gaming Platforms

For this project, I was interested in determining and analyzing the major trends for different video games sold on various gaming consoles. I used Microsoft Excel for my analysis and Power BI to create my visualizations. This analysis could be used to give business recommendations to a small gaming company looking to grow their business model.

## Project #3: Reports & Dashboards on Exercise & Fitness Data

This project involved me taking my own exercise and fitness data to create both reports and dashboards out of them using Microsoft Excel and Power BI. The reports are more static, but the summary statistics on each report page update when new data is added to the data tables. The dashboards are more dynamic in that they have a slicer that filters data shown on all the charts by date. They also have drill-down functionality.
